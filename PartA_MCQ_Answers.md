## Instructions

**COMPLETE ALL QUESTIONS FOR BOTH PART 1 AND PART 2 BELOW**

Every question here is covered by **Cyfrin Updraft - Blockchain Basics**. If you
worked through that course, you have already been taught all of this.

**How to answer:** replace the placeholder on the `**Your Answer:**` line with a
single letter, like this:

```
**Your Answer:** B
```

The auto-marker reads that line. Write only the letter - no brackets, no
explanation on that line.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **Your answers lock on the first push where all eight are filled in.** Decide
> on all eight, then push them together - changing them afterwards will not
> change your score.

Your reasoning goes in the box underneath and is marked separately, 2 marks
each. **A blank reasoning box scores zero**, so write two or three sentences
even when the answer is obvious.

## PART 1: Blockchain Fundamentals

### Question 1: Why a Blockchain At All? (3 marks + 2 for reasoning)

A community savings group asks: *"Why can't we just use a normal website with a
database?"*

**Which response shows real understanding of what a blockchain gives you?**

- **A)** "Blockchain is the future and everyone should be using it."
- **B)** "Because no single party controls the record. Every member can verify
  the contribution and payout history themselves, and no administrator - not
  even us - can quietly edit it after the fact. A database is faster and
  cheaper, so the trade is worth it only when the members do not fully trust
  whoever runs the server."
- **C)** "Because blockchains use cryptography, which makes them unhackable,
  unlike normal databases."
- **D)** "Because a database can only handle a few thousand users, and
  blockchains scale infinitely."

**Your Answer:** B

**Your Reasoning:**
[Blockchain provides security, transparency and immutability. Once the records are inserted into the database, no single person or authority can alter the records. The honest cost of choosing it is complexity; blockchain-based applications often seem too complex for non-tech savvy individuals. ]

### Question 2: Gas Costs (3 marks + 2 for reasoning)

You send a simple ETH transfer on Ethereum.

- **Gas used:** 21,000
- **Gas price:** 20 gwei
- **1 ETH = $3,000**

**What does the transaction cost?**

- **A)** 0.042 ETH (about $126)
- **B)** 0.000021 ETH (about $0.06)
- **C)** 0.00042 ETH (about $1.26)
- **D)** 0.0042 ETH (about $12.60)

**Your Answer:** C

**Your Calculation:**

- Total gas cost in gwei = 21,000 * 20 = 420,000 gwei
- Converted to ETH (remember: 1 ETH = 1,000,000,000 gwei) = 420,000 / 1,000,000,000 = 0.00042 ETH
- Converted to USD = 0.00042 * 3000 = $1.26 

[It costs more gas fees to store on a blockchain because every node on the network needs to store the same copy of the data making expensive relative to the size of the blockchain.]

---

### Question 3: The Oracle Problem (3 marks + 2 for reasoning)

Your smart contract needs to know the current ETH/USD price.

**Why can't the contract simply call a price API itself?**

- **A)** Because API calls are too expensive in gas, though they are technically
  possible.
- **B)** Because every node on the network must execute the same transaction and
  reach the same result. If each node called an API it might get a slightly
  different answer, and the nodes could never agree on the outcome. An oracle
  solves this by putting the data on-chain first, so every node reads the same
  stored value.
- **C)** Because Solidity has no networking library yet, but this is being added
  in a future upgrade.
- **D)** Because API providers block blockchain nodes for security reasons.

**Your Answer:** B

**Your Reasoning:**
[A blockchain is isolated from the from the rest of the world. Adding external data directly on-chain undermines the problem blockchain is trying to solve; central authority. Oracle solves this problem by aggregating the data to have one source of truth, verifying and applying consensus machanisms to ensure that data from off-chain is validated and free from bias when brought on chain. ]

### Question 4: Consensus and Attacks (3 marks + 2 for reasoning)

**Which statement about Proof of Stake is correct?**

- **A)** Validators compete to solve a cryptographic puzzle, and the fastest one
  wins the right to propose a block.
- **B)** Proof of Stake removes the possibility of a majority attack entirely,
  because there is no mining.
- **C)** Any node can propose blocks for free, which is what makes Proof of Stake
  cheaper than Proof of Work.
- **D)** Validators lock up capital as stake to earn the right to propose and
  attest blocks. Misbehaviour can be slashed, so attacking the chain costs the
  attacker their own stake. The cost of that stake is also what makes Sybil
  attacks - one actor spinning up thousands of fake nodes - uneconomic.

**Your Answer:** D

**Your Reasoning:**
[An attacker would need a ton amount of resources adn by resources I mean an insane amount of money amounting to high billions if not trllions given the size of the Ethereum blockchain community which is very much infisible. So 49/51 attack done by a single person or a small group of individuals is highly infisible. Proof of Work, as opposed to PoS, can be achieved by a single individual. The more mining power (powerful computers and graphic cards/processors), the more blocks an individual can mine. A monopoly is possible in Proof of Work consensus, given you have the resources. ]

### Question 5: Layer 2s and Rollups (3 marks + 2 for reasoning)

**How does a rollup make transactions cheaper than Ethereum mainnet?**

- **A)** It executes transactions off-chain, then posts the compressed results
  (with either a validity proof or a fraud-proof window) back to Ethereum. The
  cost of that single L1 posting is shared across all the transactions in the
  batch, so each user pays a fraction of it while still inheriting Ethereum's
  security for final settlement.
- **B)** It uses a faster consensus algorithm than Ethereum, so blocks are
  produced more cheaply.
- **C)** It stores transactions in a private database and never touches
  Ethereum, which is why it costs almost nothing.
- **D)** It reduces gas costs by lowering the base fee on Ethereum itself
  whenever the rollup is active.

**Your Answer:** A

**Your Reasoning:**
[A sequencer can order executions and even process transactions off-chain individually. What a sequencer cannot do is making final decisions on its own. It provide its own final security and the important one for users is that it cannot steal user funds.]

### Question 6: Wallets, Keys and Signatures (3 marks + 2 for reasoning)

A new user asks why they need a seed phrase, and why you cannot reset it for
them.

**Which explanation is correct?**

- **A)** The seed phrase is a password stored on the blockchain, so only the
  network can reset it.
- **B)** The seed phrase encrypts your funds where they sit on the chain. Losing
  it means your funds stay encrypted forever.
- **C)** Your seed phrase derives your private key, and your private key produces
  signatures that only your address can produce. That signature is how a
  contract knows a transaction is really from you, without anyone needing to
  approve it. Nobody else holds a copy, so nobody - including us - can restore
  it or reverse a transaction you signed.
- **D)** The seed phrase is just a backup of your public address, which is why it
  is safe to share with support staff if you get stuck.

**Your Answer:** C

**Your Reasoning:**
[ A signature prooves that you are the person who is actually interacting with the smart contract; it serves as you digital identity. By holding your own keys, you are in control of the activities you perform when interacting with the smart contract; everthing  points to you as an individual. This prevents fraudulent activities being done on your behalve without your consent; literally the power is in your hands. Account abstraction helps by removing rigid private key rules thus enhancing user experience. So in essense, the smart contract controls user accounts instead of a user private key.]

## PART 2: Applying It To Your Contracts

These two questions connect directly to the code you write in Part B. Answer
them before you start coding - they will save you time.

### Question 7: Randomness On-Chain (3 marks + 2 for reasoning)

Your raffle needs to pick a winner. A developer suggests:

```solidity
uint256 index = uint256(
    keccak256(abi.encodePacked(block.timestamp, block.prevrandao))
) % players.length;
```

**What is wrong with this?**

- **A)** Nothing. Hashing block data produces a value nobody can predict, which
  is exactly what randomness means.
- **B)** Every input here is public on-chain data, and the block proposer has
  some influence over it. Anyone can compute the same result inside the same
  block and act only when it favours them, and a proposer can drop or reorder a
  block to change the outcome. Real randomness has to come from outside the
  chain, verifiably - a service like Chainlink VRF, or a commit-reveal scheme.
- **C)** The problem is only the modulo, which introduces a small bias. Swapping
  to a different hash function fixes it.
- **D)** It is insecure on Ethereum but safe on a Layer 2, because the sequencer
  orders transactions privately.

**Your Answer:** B

**Your Reasoning:**
[This transaction will be visible publicly before the event/transaction takes place, as a result front-runners can manipulate the draw. The front-runner, since they get to see the draw before it plays out, they will choose their winner and mainipulate the `block.timestamp` as well as the `block.prevrandao` to force the maths logic to select their chosen block as the winner. ]

### Question 8: Paying Out Safely (3 marks + 2 for reasoning)

This function pays a freelancer:

```solidity
function approveAndPay(uint256 bountyId, address freelancer) external {
    Bounty storage b = bounties[bountyId];
    require(msg.sender == b.employer, "Not the employer");

    (bool ok, ) = freelancer.call{value: b.amount}("");
    require(ok, "Transfer failed");

    b.status = Status.Completed;
}
```

**What is the bug?**

- **A)** Nothing is wrong - the return value of `call` is checked, which is what
  matters.
- **B)** `call` is unsafe and should be replaced with `transfer`, which is the
  standard way to send ETH securely.
- **C)** The status is updated *after* the ETH is sent. If the freelancer is a
  contract, its receive function runs during that call and can call
  `approveAndPay` again while the status is still un-updated, draining the
  contract. The fix is checks-effects-interactions: set the status to Completed
  before sending.
- **D)** The `require` on `msg.sender` should use `tx.origin` instead, so that
  contracts cannot call the function at all.

**Your Answer:** C

**Your Reasoning:**
[An attacker would receive the function runs during the call and can intercept it by calling the `approveAndPay` multiple times. This leads to contract drainage since the status is only being updated once after performing the transaction. ]

## SUBMISSION CHECKLIST

- [ ] Every `**Your Answer:**` line contains a single letter and nothing else
- [ ] You gave reasoning for all 8 questions
- [ ] For Question 2 you showed your working
- [ ] You committed and pushed to your fork

**Challenges faced:** [Question 8 was a bit tricky for me. I used the answer from the MCQ to find my way in explaining the steps an attacking contract would use. More practice and writing more contracts will definitely result in tremendeous growth. Otherwise the MCQs this time are clear to me, given I have already been exposed to this assessment and used it mostly to prepare for this one. ]
